1. When a user registers or logs in, Hawcx Authentication generates a unique set of cryptographic keys for that user.
2. These keys are used in combination with server-side challenges to authenticate the user securely.
3. Once authenticated, Hawcx Authentication provides secure storage for session tokens and other sensitive data.
4. All operations involving sensitive data (reading, writing, transmitting) are handled through the Hawcx Authentication, ensuring consistent security measures are applied.

By handling these complex security operations, Hawcx Authentication allows developers to focus on building great features while ensuring their app meets the highest security standards.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication with ease, including biometric integration.
- **Data Encryption**: Protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols.
- **Secure Communication**: Ensure all network communications are encrypted and protected against man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Tamper Detection**: Identify and respond to attempts to modify or reverse engineer your application.
- **Secure Storage**: Safely store sensitive data such as tokens, keys, and user information.
