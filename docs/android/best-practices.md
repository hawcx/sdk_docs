# Best Practices

Implementing Hawcx in your Android application is like upgrading from a tricycle to a supercharged motorcycle for security. We’re working hard to add features that will make your life easier and your app more secure. Keep an eye out for updates—you won’t want to miss them!

## 1. Initialization and Configuration

- **Initialize Early**: Always initialize HawcxInitializer in your Application class's `onCreate()` method to ensure it's ready when your app starts.

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        HawcxInitializer.getInstance().init(this, "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE");
    }
}
```

- **Secure API Keys**: Never hardcode your Hawcx API key in your source code. Use secure storage methods or obfuscation techniques.

## 2. Authentication

- **Use Biometric Authentication**: For sensitive operations, implement biometric authentication when available.

```java

signIn.checkLastUser(this);

@Override
public void initiateBiometricLogin(Runnable onSuccess) {
    // Handle Biometric Auth
}
```

<!-- ## 3. Data Protection

- **Encrypt All Sensitive Data**: Use Hawcx's encryption methods for all sensitive data before storing or transmitting.

```java
import com.hawcx.util.EncryptedSharedPreferencesUtil;

EncryptedSharedPreferencesUtil.setString(context, "key", senstiveData); 
EncryptedSharedPreferencesUtil.setLong(context, "key", senstiveData); 
``` -->

## 4. Error Handling and Logging

- **Implement Proper Error Handling**: Always catch and handle exceptions thrown by Hawcx Authentication methods.

```java
try {
    // Hawcx Authentication operation
} catch (HawcxException e) {
    Log.e("HawcxError", "Operation failed: " + e.getMessage());
    // Handle the error appropriately
}
```

- **Secure Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive information. Use Hawcx Authentication's secure logging features for debugging.

```java
HawcxLogger.log(LogLevel.INFO, "User action completed", "UserAction");
```


By following these best practices, you can ensure that you're using Hawcx Authentication effectively and maximizing the security of your Android application. Remember to review the [API documentation](api-reference.md) for detailed information on each feature and method mentioned here.
